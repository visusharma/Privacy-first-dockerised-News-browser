# Privacy-First Dockerized (News) Browser

## The Why

This project was born out of frustration with modern news consumption. Today's news platforms increasingly rely on behavioral tracking, user profiling, and recommendation algorithms to "personalize" our news experience. While personalization can be useful in some contexts, it creates an echo chamber in news consumption - a scenario where we're shown what algorithms think we want to see, rather than what we need to see.

### The Problem

- News recommendations based on tracking create bubbles of information
- User behavior tracking influences what news we see
- Privacy concerns with persistent user profiles
- Difficulty in getting "clean", non-personalized news views
- Cookie tracking across news sites creating linked profiles

### The Solution

This tool provides a privacy-focused approach to news consumption. It uses a dockerized browser with Tor integration, ensuring:

- Each browsing session is clean and trackless
- No persistent cookies or user profiles
- Access to news without algorithmic bias
- Protection from cross-site tracking
- Option to bypass regional restrictions through Tor

## Philosophy

News should be a window to understand our world, not a mirror reflecting our existing views and behaviors. This tool embodies the belief that:

- News consumption should be free from algorithmic manipulation
- Privacy is a fundamental right in information access
- Users should control their information exposure
- Clean-slate browsing leads to broader perspectives

## Features

- üîí Privacy-first approach with Tor network support
- üê≥ Fully dockerized application
- üåê Support for both regular and Tor-enabled browsing
- üîÑ Automatic link handling within the privacy context
- üì∞ Perfect for reading news while maintaining privacy
- üõ°Ô∏è Built-in protection against tracking
- üö´ Blocks unnecessary resources (ads, trackers, etc.)
- üåç Access to geo-restricted content through Tor
- üñ•Ô∏è Desktop launcher for easy access

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git (optional)

## Installation

### Desktop Launcher Setup

For convenient access, follow these steps to set up a desktop launcher:

1. Run the `setup.bat` script once to create desktop shortcuts and finalize installation
2. Click the "Privacy News Browser" icon on your desktop to launch the application
3. Use the application launcher page to browse news sites with or without Tor

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/privacy-first-dockerised-browser.git
cd privacy-first-dockerised-browser
```

2. Build and start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`
